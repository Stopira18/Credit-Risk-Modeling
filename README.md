# Credit-Risk-Modeling
Probability of Default Model Using Python
NB:this is a basic logistic regression 

In recent years, finance officers and bankers have faced numerous challenges all over the world 
on risks they are exposed to, such us compliance, operational and credit risk etc.…. The ability to 
lend money to borrower/ debtor with or without information. Therefore, skills and tools to 
predict and measure a probability of default or expected loss are being developed by financial 
institutions. Nowadays financial institutions rely on quantitative analysis and statistical models.
In this paper, we develop a logistic regression in the purpose of predicting and classifying good 
and bad credit applicants and compare the logistic regression model prediction score with the 
Naïve Bayes, SVM , Random forest and XGBOOST one.
